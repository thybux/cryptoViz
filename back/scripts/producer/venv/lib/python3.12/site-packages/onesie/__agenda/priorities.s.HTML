priorities:

	ordered:
		most important:
		
			[ ] if "exit ()" is called by a process,
				this might cause a problem...
		
			[ ] before and after a check irregardless of whether
				it is successful or not.
				
				
				def after_check_1 ():
					return;
				
				def check_1 ():
					return;
					
				def before_check_1 ():
					return;
					
				checks = {
					"check 1": {
						"after": after_check_1,
						"check": check_1,
						"before": before_check_1
					}
				}
				
				------------------------
					def establish_1 ():
						return;
					
					establish = {
						"establish 1": {
							"
						}
					}
			
			[ ] static type checking
			
				https://pypi.org/project/mypy/
	
			[ ] coverage
				https://pypi.org/project/coverage/
				
				subprocesses:
					https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.5.0/subprocess.html
			
			[ ] capture process journal:
			
					This might have binary
					
					Could try utf8, the if doesn't
					work could try hex
					
					journal: [{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "no",
							"string": "journal entry"
						},
						"hexadecimal": ""
					},{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "no",
							"string": "journal entry"
						},
						"hex": ""
					}]
					
					journal: [{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "no"
						},
						"hex": [
							"034789A987F789C987987A78987B987987987D7898F",
						]
					},{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "yes"
							"string": "journal entry"
						}
					},{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "yes"
							"string": "journal entry"
						}
					}]
				
		
			[ ] "checks" or "courses"
		
			[ ] The unit_tests from body_scan
				need to be rewritten as body_scan tests
				for onesie.
				
			[ ]	global option to repeat checks if they fail,
				since there are possibilites like "deadlocks"
			
			[ ] mkdir -p, db_directory
		
			[ ] print the passed checks history numbers in the results.
			
					status checks [113 to 103]: [45][43][43][42][40]

					#
					#	That way can easily notice if that number decreases
					#	suddenly for some reason.
					#	
			
			
			[ ] Somehow showing processes that are still in progress,
				in the event that one doesn't stop ever or something.
			
			[ ]	A way to start multiple globs.			
			
				scan = onesie.start_s2 (
					#
					#	run globs simultaneously or 
					#
					"simultaneous": "yes",
					
					"scans": [{			
						#
						#	required
						#
						"glob_string": glob_string,
						
						#
						#	optional
						#
						"name": "vitals",
						"simultaneous": "yes",
						"module_paths": [],
						"relative_path": chassis
					}]
				)
		
		
		not as important:
			[ ] websockets to vue frontend
				pypi "websockets"

	unordered:
		(body scan priorities might have more)
