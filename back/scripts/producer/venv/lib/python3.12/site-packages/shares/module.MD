## "shares" is no longer the name of this endeavor.    
# The endeavor continues as "sphene".  
[https://pypi.org/project/sphene](https://pypi.org/project/sphene)    

If there are problems with "shares", change requests    
might still be addressed.   

******

Bravo!  You have received a Mercantilism Diploma in "shares" from     
the Orbital Convergence University International Air and Water  
Embassy of the üçä Planet (the planet that is one ellipse further from  
the Sun than Earth's ellipse).  

You are now officially certified to include "shares" in your practice.

# shares

---

## description
Started from the shell, "shares" presents files in the current working directory (cwd) that have extension ".s.HTML" (case sensitive).

---		
		
## install
`[ZSH] pip install shares`

---


## start from shell
`[ZSH] shares`

Shares starts on port 2345, or the first avaible port after that.  
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:2345  

This is the equivalent of:   
`[ZSH] shares start --port 2345`   

--
  
Alternatively you can add `--static-port` and "shares"   
stops if the port specified is unavailable.  
`[ZSH] shares start --port 2345 --static-port`

### This is an example ".s.HTML" file.


```
<pre>
	<h1>This is an example HTML file.</h1>
	<p>
		It really only needs the "pre" tag to    
		look like a reflection of its contents in a browser.   
	</p>   
	<p>
		Tags like "html" and "body" are actually not   
		necessary for rendering HTML in modern browsers.  
	</p>   
	<p>  
		for text to wrap, instead of extending off the page,    
		style "white-space: pre-wrap" can be utilized instead of 
		a "pre" tag like so:
		
		<div style="white-space: pre-wrap"></div>
	</p>
</pre>
```

with scaling based on the browser screen "viewport" of the screen,
